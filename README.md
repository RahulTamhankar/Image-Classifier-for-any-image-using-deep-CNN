# Image-Classifier-for-any-image-using-deep-CNN
This is an image classifier for classifying happy and sad faces of people using deep CNN
Convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet) are a subclass of neural networks that are mostly employed in voice and image recognition applications. With no loss of information, its integrated convolutional layer lowers the high dimensionality of images. CNNs are therefore very well suited for this use case.

Image Classifiaction has many applications in todays world and I have also tried to make a project where I implement image classification using Deep CNN.
In this project, the deep CNN model predicts whether or not the has a happy face or a sad face.
Here is one of the output which I tested-
For a happy face input the model correctly preditcs that the class is a happy class,
